Installing with CMake
=====================

CMake is a configuration tool that performs system discovery and generates
build scripts for the host (or target) platform. To build with CMake,
execute the following commands:

    $ tar zxf log4g.tar.gz
    $ cd log4g
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../bootstrap
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Documentation
=============

Log4g is documented using Doxygen. If CMake finds Doxygen during configuration
a `doc' target will be generated in the Makefile. Execute the following
command to build the documentation:

    $ make doc

Once the documentation is generated, point your web browser to:

    build/doc/html/index.html

Dependencies
============

To build with CMake, the CMake application is required. For more information
on CMake, see:

    http://www.cmake.org/

GNU Make is also recommended:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Log4g depends on the GLib-2.0 & GObject-2.0 libraries. For more information
on GLib (GObject is a part of GLib), see:

    http://www.gtk.org/

The Log4g DOM parser module uses LibXML-2.0. For more information on LibXML,
see:
