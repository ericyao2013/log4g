Log4g - A GObject-based logging utility
=======================================

This is Log4g, a port of Log4j to the GObject framework. For more information
on Log4j, see:

    http://logging.apache.org/log4j/

The initial intent of this project was to learn the GObject framework (and
indirectly some Java) by porting Log4j classes directly to GObject classes.
Hopefully some users of GLib and GObject will find this library useful.

Quickstart
==========

Setting up Log4g in your application requires three simple steps:

1. Include the main Log4g header file

    #include <log4g/log4g.h>

2. Initialize the Log4g system

    log4g_init(&argc, &argv);

The initialization function should be called before you use the logging API.
If you plan to use threads in your program you must initialize the GLib
threading API before you initialize Log4g. If the threading system has not
been initialized before calling log4g_init() then Log4g will not perform
any locking or attempt to use any threading features.

3. Insert logging statements into your application

    log4g_error("program failure: %s", error->message);

Log4g supports the notion of logging levels. There are 5 default logging
levels in Log4g (custom logging levels are also supported). The default log
levels are:

    * TRACE: log4g_trace()
    * DEBUG: log4g_debug()
    * INFO: log4g_info()
    * WARN: log4g_warn()
    * ERROR: log4g_error()
    * FATAL: log4g_fatal()

If you would like to use a logger other than the root logger, you can
define the macro LOG4G_LOG_DOMAIN before including the Log4g header file:

    #define LOG4G_LOG_DOMAIN ("org.gnome.test")
    #include <log4g/log4g.h>

This sets the Log4g logging domain for the duration of that file. To use
multiple logger instances from within the same file you will need to use a
slightly different API:

    log4g_logger_error(log4g_get_logger("org.gnome.foo"),
            "program failure: %s", error->message);

    log4g_logger_warn(log4g_get_logger("org.gnome.bar"),
            "you had better watch out %s", name);

These two log statements would use the "org.gnome.foo" & "org.gnome.bar"
loggers respectively. Logger names use a class hierarchy in which classes
are separated by the dot (".") character.

3.1 Cleanup the logger hierarchy

    log4g_finalize();

It is not strictly necessary to call finalize, however this will destroy the
logger hierarchy. This may become important if you are using an asynchronous
logger. Destroying the hierarchy will ensure that any pending asynchronous
log messages are flushed before your application exits.

If you have used the default configuration (as in this example), log messages
will be printed to stdout using the TTCC layout. For information on how to
configure Log4g refer to the detailed documentation.

Installation
============

See INSTALL for detailed build and installation instructions.

Log4g ships with an Autotools build environment. First run the provided
configure script (supplying any desired options) and then run make:

    $ tar zxf log4g.tar.gz
    $ cd log4g
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Note: If you are building an unstable release (cloned with git) then you will
      have to generate the configure script by running autogen.sh. This
      requires that you have autoconf, automake and libtool installed. Refer
      to the Autotools documentation for more information.

CMake is a build configuration tool that performs system discovery and
generates build scripts for the host (or target) platform. To build with
CMake, execute the following commands:

    $ tar zxf log4g.tar.gz
    $ cd log4g
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../bootstrap
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Note: The CMake build scripts are only included in unstable releases (cloned
      with git).

Documentation
=============

Log4g is documented using Doxygen. If CMake finds Doxygen during configuration
a `doc' target will be generated in the Makefile. Execute the following
command to build the documentation:

    $ make doc

Once the documentation is generated, point your web browser to:

    build/doc/html/index.html

A reasonably up to date version of the documentation can be found at:

    http://msteinert.github.com/log4g/documentation.html

Dependencies
============

To build with CMake, the CMake application is required. For more information
on CMake, see:

    http://www.cmake.org/

GNU Make is also recommended:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Log4g depends on the GLib-2.0 & GObject-2.0 libraries. For more information
on GLib (GObject is a part of GLib), see:

    http://www.gtk.org/

The Log4g DOM parser module uses LibXML-2.0. For more information on LibXML,
see:
